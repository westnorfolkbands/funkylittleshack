    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <b>Funky Little Shack </b> <i>— the West Norfolk party starters!</i>
<p>From Motown magic to Dua Lipa bangers (and everything in between), we deliver nothing but floor-fillers to keep your night buzzing. Born from a love of amateur dramatics and a Disney cover project (Big Summer Blowout), we’ve kept the fun alive — and yes, we can still sneak in a Disney hit or two if you ask nicely. Our mission? Simple: keep the party going all night long.</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>Can I book you for our event?</summary>
      <p>Of course, we'd love to help bring music to your weddings, parties and events,</p>

      <summary>What do you need?</summary>
      <p>Firstly a good power supply, ideally at least 2 sockets, even better if there are more. Space wise, we try to work with what you have - the more the better, but as there are 5 of us, PA, lights, a drum kit, amps we need at least 4 x 3 m. We need time to set up - a minimum of 1 hour before you want us to play, and an hour after.</p>
